## Description
YEPPBot is a Twitch bot equipped with multiple features to entertain and manage your Twitch channel.

Originally conceived by [FoxxHimself](https://GitHub.com/lennartfu) and written in Python in early 2021. <br>
I took over the project after the original creator ceased development and rewrote it using Java 21 with the [Twitch4J](https://Twitch4J.GitHub.io/) library. <br> <br>

## Usage
Experience the bot by visiting its [Twitch](https://www.Twitch.tv/YEPPBotV2/chat) chat page to see its features in action. <br>
Add the bot to your channel with the command `!mod join`. <br>
Should you wish to remove it, use `!mod leave` in your channel.

For all features to work as intended, you need to authenticate the bot with your Twitch account using `!mod auth` in your channel. <br>
It's recommended to assign the bot a moderator role, although it isn't strictly necessary. <br> <br>

## Contact and Support
For support or inquiries, reach out via [Discord](https://www.mcmodersd.de/dc), [mail](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de), or [Twitch](https://www.Twitch.tv/mcmodersd). <br>
I typically respond within 24 hours, oftentimes sooner.

Interested in collaboration or a custom version tailored to your needs? Simply email [business@mcmodersd.de](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de). 

Note that the bot is under active development, and some features may change considerably in the future. <br>
Consequently, the setup process may also evolve. <br> <br>

## Host Your Own Instance
Utilize this project as a template to create your own bot or to host an instance. <br>
You have three options to run the bot:
- [Docker](#docker)
- [Precompiled JAR](#precompiled-jar)
- [Manual Setup](#manual-setup)

Regardless of the method, you must create the configuration files following the [Configuration](#configuration) section guidelines. <br>
Use the `-generate` argument to create example configuration files as templates.

<hr>

### Docker
Run the bot in a Docker container. The Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcmodersd/yeppbot). <br>
Mount your configuration files to the container at `/app/config`.

<hr>

### Precompiled JAR
Ensure Java 21 is installed on your computer, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21). <br>
Download the latest version from the [releases](https://GitHub.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot/releases/latest) page. <br>
Execute the precompiled JAR, specifying the absolute paths to the configuration files:
```bash
java -jar YEPPBot.jar -bot "/path/to/bot.json" -sql "/path/to/sql.json" -server "/path/to/server.json" and so on...
```

Arguments for configuration files include:
- `-bot "/path/to/bot.json"`: Specifies the bot configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-channels "/path/to/channels.txt"`: Specifies the channel list file path. **(optional)**
- `-sql "/path/to/sql.json"`: Specifies the MariaDB configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-server "/path/to/server.json"`: Specifies the HTTPS server configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-api "/path/to/api.json"`: Specifies the API keys configuration file path. **(optional)**
- `-openai "/path/to/openai.json"`: Specifies the ChatGPT configuration file path. **(optional)**

Other available arguments:
- `-help`: Displays a list of all available arguments.
- `-version`: Outputs the current version of the bot.
- `-cli`: Runs the bot in command-line interface mode.
- `-nolog`: Disables database logging.
- `-noninteractive`: Disables interactive mode.
- `-container`: Activates Docker container mode.
- `-generate`: Generates example configuration files.

<hr>

### Manual Setup
Compile and run the bot manually by first installing Java 21. Download Java 21 [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21). <br>
Clone the project into your IDE and place the following configuration files in `/src/main/resources/`:
- Put `bot.json`, `channels.txt`, and `server.json` in `/src/main/resources/config/`.
- Put `sql.json` in `/src/main/resources/database/`.
- Put `api.json` and `openai.json` in `/src/main/resources/api/`.

Build and run the project thereafter. <br> <br>

## Configuration
Before starting configuration:
1. Create a Twitch application in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
2. Create a Twitch account for the bot. (Your own account works, but is not recommended).
3. Generate a MariaDB database and user for the bot.

Account tokens may become invalid over time or if the password changes. <br> 
Remember **never share or post the token**. <br> <br>

### Bot Configuration
Create `bot.json` with this structure:
```json
{
  "botId": "YOUR_BOT_ID",
  "botName": "YOUR_BOT_NAME, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS",
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "prefix": "! ยก",
  "admins": "ADMIN_NAME; OTHER_ADMIN_NAME"
}
```
- **botId**: The Twitch user ID of the bot account, obtained via this [username to ID converter](https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/).
- **botName**: The bot account's name. Allow multiple names separated by commas for recognition.
- **botToken**: Generate the bot account's token [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- **clientId** and **clientSecret**: Credentials of your Twitch application.
  - Create an application in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
  - Set `https://localhost:PORT/callback` as the OAuth redirect URL or use a domain pointed to your server.
  - Select **Chatbot** as the category and **Confidential** as the client type.
- **prefix**: Characters for command recognition.
- **admins**: Users with access to admin commands.

The prefix identifies commands. <br>
Admins can execute all commands in any channel. <br> <br>

### Channel List (optional)
The optional `channels.txt` file should feature this format:
```
CHANNEL_NAME
OTHER_CHANNEL_NAME
```
List as many channels as desired. <br>
Without this list, the bot is active in its own channel only. <br> <br>

### MariaDB Database
A MariaDB database is required for data storage. <br>
The bot creates the necessary tables automatically. <br>

Create a MariaDB database and user with:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE DATABASE_NAME;
CREATE USER 'USER_NAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'USER_PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE_NAME.* TO 'USER_NAME'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
If the bot and database run on the same server, use `localhost` in place of `%`.

Create `sql.json` structured like:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": "3306",
  "database": "DATABASE_NAME",
  "username": "USER_NAME",
  "password": "USER_PASSWORD"
}
```
- **host**: Hostname/IP where MariaDB is hosted, e.g., `localhost`.
- **port**: Default MariaDB listening port (`3306`).
- **database**: The bot's database name.
- **username**: The MariaDB user with database access.
- **password**: Password for the MariaDB user.

Ensure the user has complete database permissions. <br>
Use `-nolog` to disable database logging. <br> <br>

### HTTPS Server
The bot features a built-in HTTPS server for Twitch Helix API authentication and forthcoming features.

Create `server.json` structured like:
```json
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HOSTNAME",
  "port": 443,
  "host": true,
  "proxy": "YOUR_PROXY",

  "SSL": {
    "fullchain": "/path/to/fullchain.pem",
    "privkey": "/path/to/privkey.pem"
  },

  "JKS": {
    "file": "keystore.jks",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "validity": 365,
    "CN": "Your Name",
    "OU": "Your Organization Unit",
    "O": "Your Organization",
    "L": "Your Location",
    "ST": "Your State",
    "C": "Your Country"
  }
}
```

### API Keys (optional)
Configure `api.json` for API keys:
```json
{
  "astrology": {
    "clientId": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_ID, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_SECRET, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_SECRET"
