## Description
The YEPPBot is a Twitch-Bot that provides a variety of features to entertain and manage your Twitch channel. <br>

The original idea comes from [FoxxHimself](https://github.com/lennartfu) and was written in Python back in the first half of 2021. <br>
After the original creator stopped working on and maintaining the bot, I took over its maintenance and decided to rewrite it in Java.
The bot has since been fully rewritten in Java 21 using the [Twitch4J](https://twitch4j.github.io/) library. <br>

You can try out the bot on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/YEPPBotV2/chat) to see its features in action. <br>
To use the bot in your own channel, you can add it to your channel using the `!mod join` command. <br>
If you wish to remove the bot from your channel, use the `!mod leave` command in your channel. <br> <br>

For all features to work as intended, you need to authenticate the bot with your Twitch account using the `!mod auth` command in your channel. <br>
While it's recommended to assign the bot a moderator role in your channel to unlock all features, this is not strictly necessary. <br> <br>

If you need help or have any questions, feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://www.mcmodersd.de/dc), [mail](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de) or [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mcmodersd). <br>
I typically respond within 24 hours, often much faster. <br>

If you're interested in collaborating or need a customized version to suit your needs? <br>
Simply email [business@mcmodersd.de](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de). <br> <br>

The bot is currently under active development, and some features may undergo significant changes in the future. <br>
So please note that the setup process for the bot may also change over time. <br>

<hr>

You can use this project as a template to create your own bot or to host your own instance of it. <br>
Setting up the bot is relatively straightforward: you need to create the configuration files and input the required API keys. <br>

However, it is necessary to create a [Twitch application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and provide access to a MySQL database. <br>
For ChatGPT features, as well as certain other features, you need to provide their respective API keys for them to function properly. <br>

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. <br> <br>

## Installation and Setup
For the bot to work, you need to have a few things set up:
- You need to have Java 21 installed on your computer a download link can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
- You need the Twitch account token of the Twitch bot which you can get from [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- And you need to register an application on the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).

Keep in mind that the account token can become invalid after a while and if you change the password of the account. <br>
But remember **DON'T POST** or ever **SHARE** the token anywhere!!! <br> <br>


### 1. Download the bot jar file
You can download the latest version of the bot from the [releases](https://github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot/releases/latest) page. <br>
Create the configuration files yourself, or use the `-generate` argument to create example files. <br>

YAlternatively, you can clone the repository and compile the bot yourself.
To do this, ensure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). <br>

Clone the repository using the following command: <br>
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot.git 
``` 
<br>


### 2. Edit the config files
You need to fill in the configuration files with the required information. <br> 
Ignore the names or paths if you use the precompiled JAR file. <br>

You must create two JSON files in the `/src/main/resources/config/` folder. <br>
The first file is `BotConfig.json` and should have the following structure: <br>
```json
{
  "botId": "YOUR_BOT_ID",
  "botName": "YOUR_BOT_NAME, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS",
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "prefix": "! ยก",
  "admins": "ADMIN_NAME; OTHER_ADMIN_NAME"
}
```
- **botId**: The ID of the bot account, which you can obtain using this [username to id converter](https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/).
- **botName**: The name of the bot account. You can use multiple names separated by commas so the bot can recognize when it's mentioned.
- **botToken**: The token of the bot account, which you can generate [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The credentials for your Twitch application. 
  - You need to create an application in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). 
  - For testing purposes, use `https://localhost:PORT/callback` as the OAuth Redirect URL. <br> For production, ensure the URL points to your server.
  - Set the application category to **Chatbot** and the Client Type to **Confidential**.
- **prefix**: The character(s) the bot will use to recognize commands.
- **admins**: The users who will have access to admin commands. <br>

The prefix is the character that the bot will use to recognize commands. <br>
The admins are the users that have access to the admin commands. <br>

The second file is optional and is called `Channel.list`. It should have the following structure: <br>
```
CHANNEL_NAME
OTHER_CHANNEL_NAME
``` 
You can add as many channels as you like. 
If no channel list is provided, the bot will default to joining its own channel. <br> <br>


### 3. MySQL Database
To run and use the bot, you need to have your own MySQL database. <br> 
The bot will automatically create the necessary tables and handle the setup, but you must provide a configuration file. <br>

Create a file named `mySQL.json` in the `/src/main/resources/database/`folder. <br> 
The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": "3306",
  "database": "DATABASE_NAME",
  "username": "USER_NAME",
  "password": "USER_PASSWORD"
}
```

- **host**: The hostname or IP address of your MySQL server (e.g., `localhost`). 
- **port**: The port your MySQL server is listening on (default is `3306`).
- **database**: The name of the database the bot will use.
- **username**: The MySQL user with access to the database.
- **password**: The password for the MySQL user.

Ensure that the specified user has full permissions over the entire database. <br>
If you don't want to use the database logging, you can use the `-nolog` argument. <br> <br>


### 4. HTTPS Server
The YEPPBot includes a simple HTTPS server to handle Helix API authentication. <br> 
It can also be used to broadcast sound via a browser page. <br>

To configure the server, create a file named `httpsServer.json` in the `/src/main/resources/config/` folder. <br> 
The file should have the following structure: <br>
```json
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HOSTNAME",
  "port": 420,
  "keystore": "/keys/keystore.jks",
  "fullchain": "/path/to/fullchain.pem",
  "privkey": "/path/to/privkey.pem"
}
```

#### Key Configuration Notes:
- **hostname**: Specify your server's hostname or use `localhost` for local testing. 
- **port**: Set the port for the HTTPS server.
- **keystore**: Path to your Java KeyStore (JKS) file. 
- **fullchain**: Path to the certificate chain file (for non-JKS setups). 
- **privkey**: Path to the private key file (for non-JKS setups).

#### Localhost and Self-Signed Certificates:
You can use localhost with a self-signed JKS file for testing. However:
- The Twitch API will work with self-signed certificates.
- OBS will not accept self-signed certificates for the browser source.

#### Generating a Self-Signed Certificate:
To create a self-signed JKS file, use the following command:
```bash
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048
```
- Set the **password** to the bot token, hashed with **SHA-256** and encoded in **Base64**.
- Use this [SHA-256 hash tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html) to generate the hash.
 - Ensure **UTF-8** is selected as the input encoding. 
 - Set **Base64** as the output format.

#### Using a Domain and Valid Certificates:
If you have a domain, you must use a valid certificate. Self-signed certificates are only allowed for `localhost`.
You can obtain a free certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). <br> <br>


### 5. Add API Keys
To configure the bot with API keys, create a file named `apiKeys.json` in the `/src/main/resources/api/` folder. <br> 
The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "astrology": {
    "clientId": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_ID, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_SECRET, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_SECRET"
  },

  "giphy": "YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY",
  "openWeatherMap": "YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY"
}
```
If you do not wish to use a specific API or do not have the corresponding API key, you can omit that part of the configuration.

#### API Key Sources:
- **Astrology API**: Currently only used for the horoscope feature. Obtain your key from [Prokerala](https://api.prokerala.com/).
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used for the weather command. Obtain your key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- **Giphy API**: Used for GIF integration. Obtain your key from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/). <br> <br>


### 6. Add a ChatGPT API key
You only need to configure this module if you plan to use it. 
For example, if you donโt want to use the image module, you can omit the image part of the configuration. <br>

To set up, create a file named `ChatGPT.json` in the `/src/main/resources/api/` folder. <br> 
The file should have the following structure: <br>
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",

  "chat": {
    "chatModel": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    "maxConversationCalls": 10,
    "maxTokenSpendingLimit": 8192,
    "temperature": 1,
    "maxTokens": 120,
    "topP": 1,
    "frequencyPenalty": 0,
    "presencePenalty": 0,
    "instruction": "You are the best TwitchBot that ever existed!"
  },

  "image": {
    "imageModel": "dall-e-2",
    "quality": "standard",
    "resolution": "1024x1024",
    "style": "vivid"
  },

  "speech": {
    "ttsModel": "tts-1",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "speed": 1,
    "format": "wav"
  },

  "transcription": {
    "transcriptionModel": "whisper-1",
    "prompt": "Transcribe the following audio file to German.",
    "language": "German",
    "temperature": 1
  }
}
```
You can obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup). <br>

- The **maxTokenSpendingLimit** is the limit of tokens spent per conversatition. <br>
  After the limit is reached, the conversation will end. <br>


- The **temperature** is the randomness of the text. <br>
  Lowering results in less random completions. As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic
  and repetitive. <br>
  Higher temperature results in more random completions. <br>
  The min value is 0 and the max value is 2. <br>


- The **maxTokens** is the maximum length of the response text. <br>
  One token is roughly 4 characters for standard English text. <br>
  The limit is 16,383 tokens, but it's recommended to use a value that is suitable for the use, on Twitch the message
  limit is 500 characters.
  If you divide the limit by 4, you are an estimate the number of characters. <br>


- The **topP** is the nucleus sampling. <br>
  The lower the value, the more plain the text will be. <br>
  The higher the value, the more creative the text will be. <br>
  The min value is 0 and the max value is 1. <br>


- The **frequencyPenalty** reduces the likelihood of repeating the same words in a response.
  The higher the value, the less the bot will repeat itself. <br>
  The min value is 0 and the max value is 1. <br>


- The **presencePenalty** reduces the likelihood of mentioning words that have already appeared in the
  conversation. <br>
  The higher the value, the less the bot will repeat itself. <br>
  The min value is 0 and the max value is 1. <br>


- The **instruction** is the way the bot should behave and how he should reply to the prompt. <br>
