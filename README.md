# [YEPPBot -  YEPP it's a Twitch Bot](https://www.Twitch.tv/YEPPBotV2)

<br>

## Description
YEPPBot is a comprehensive Twitch bot featuring numerous tools to entertain and manage your Twitch channel.

Originally conceived by [FoxxHimself](https://GitHub.com/lennartfu) and written in Python in early 2021. <br>
I took over the project after the original creator ceased development and rewrote it using Java 21 with the [Twitch4J](https://Twitch4J.GitHub.io/) library. <br>

<br>

## Usage
You can explore the bot's features live on its [Twitch chat](https://www.Twitch.tv/YEPPBotV2/chat). <br>
To integrate it with your channel, use the command `!mod join`. <br>
If you ever want to remove it, simply use `!mod leave`. <br>

For optimal functionality, it's necessary to authenticate the bot with your Twitch account via `!mod auth`. <br>
While not mandatory, assigning the bot a moderator role is advised for all features to work as intended. <br>

<br>

## Contact and Support
For support or inquiries, reach out via [Discord](https://www.mcmodersd.de/dc), [mail](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de), or [Twitch](https://www.Twitch.tv/mcmodersd). <br>
I typically respond within 24 hours, oftentimes sooner.

Interested in collaboration or a custom version tailored to your needs? Simply email [business@mcmodersd.de](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de).

Note that the bot is under active development, and some features may change considerably in the future. <br>
Consequently, the setup process may also evolve. <br>

<br>

## Host Your Own Instance
You can use this project as a template to create your own bot or to host an instance. <br>
You have three options to host and run the bot:
- [Docker](#docker)
- [Precompiled JAR](#precompiled-jar)
- [Manual Setup](#manual-setup)

Regardless of your chosen method, you'll need to prepare configuration files according to the [Configuration](#configuration) section instructions. <br>
You can generate example configuration files using the `-generate` argument.

<hr>

### Docker
You can run the bot within a Docker container. <br>
The Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcmodersd/yeppbot). <br>
Make sure to mount your configuration files to the container at `/app/config`.

<hr>

### Precompiled JAR
Ensure that Java 21 is installed on your system, which is available [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21). <br>
Download the latest version from the [releases](https://GitHub.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot/releases/latest) page. <br>
Run the precompiled JAR, providing absolute paths to the required configuration files:
```bash
java -jar YEPPBot.jar -bot "/path/to/bot.json" -sql "/path/to/sql.json" -server "/path/to/server.json" ...
```

Arguments for configuration files include:
- `-bot "/path/to/bot.json"`: Specifies the bot configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-channels "/path/to/channels.txt"`: Specifies the channel list file path. **(optional)**
- `-sql "/path/to/sql.json"`: Specifies the MariaDB configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-server "/path/to/server.json"`: Specifies the HTTPS server configuration file path. **(required)**
- `-api "/path/to/api.json"`: Specifies the API keys configuration file path. **(optional)**
- `-openai "/path/to/openai.json"`: Specifies the ChatGPT configuration file path. **(optional)**

Other available arguments:
- `-help`: Lists all available arguments.
- `-version`: Displays the current version of the bot.
- `-cli`: Runs the bot in command-line mode.
- `-nolog`: Disables database logging.
- `-noninteractive`: Disables interactive mode.
- `-container`: Enables Docker container mode.
- `-generate`: Produces example configuration files.

<hr>

### Manual Setup
To manually compile and run the bot, first, install Java 21 as detailed [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21). <br>
Clone the project into your IDE and organize the configuration files:
- `bot.json`, `channels.txt`, and `server.json` should be in `/src/main/resources/config/`.
- `sql.json` should be in `/src/main/resources/database/`.
- `api.json` and `openai.json` should be in `/src/main/resources/api/`.

Build and run the project following setup. <br>

<br>

## Configuration
Before setting up: <br>

1. Create a Twitch app through the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
2. Establish a Twitch account for the bot (using your own is viable but not ideal).
3. Set up a MariaDB database and user for the bot.

Account tokens may become invalid over time or if the password changes. <br>
Remember **never share or post the token**. <br>

<br>

### Bot Configuration
Create `bot.json` with this format:
```json
{
  "botId": "YOUR_BOT_ID",
  "botName": "YOUR_BOT_NAME, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS",
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "prefix": "! ยก",
  "admins": "ADMIN_NAME; OTHER_ADMIN_NAME"
}
```
- **botId**: Retrieve the Twitch user ID for the bot account using [this converter](https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/).
- **botName**: The bot's account name, allowing multiple recognitions separated by commas.
- **botToken**: Generate your bot account's token [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- **clientId** and **clientSecret**: Details from your Twitch app.
  - Create the application in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
  - Set `https://localhost:PORT/callback` for OAuth redirect or your server's domain.
  - Opt for **Chatbot** category and **Confidential** for the client type.
- **prefix**: Symbols used to trigger commands.
- **admins**: Users allowed admin command execution. Admins can use all commands across channels.

<br>

### Channel List (optional)
Create `channels.txt` in this format:
```plaintext
CHANNEL_NAME
OTHER_CHANNEL_NAME
```

List as many channels as needed. <br>
Without this list, the bot will function only in its own channel. <br>

<br>

### MariaDB Database
You must set up a MariaDB database for data management. <br>
The bot auto-generates necessary tables. <br>

Set up MariaDB using:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE DATABASE_NAME;
CREATE USER 'USER_NAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'USER_PASSWORD';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE_NAME.* TO 'USER_NAME'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
If the bot and database share a server, replace `%` with `localhost`. <br>

Create `sql.json` like:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": "3306",
  "database": "DATABASE_NAME",
  "username": "USER_NAME",
  "password": "USER_PASSWORD"
}
```
- **host**: Hostname/IP where MariaDB is hosted, e.g., `localhost`.
- **port**: Default MariaDB listening port (`3306`).
- **database**: The bot's database name.
- **username**: The MariaDB user with database access.
- **password**: Password for the MariaDB user.

Ensure the user has full permissions on the database. <br>
Use `-nolog` to disable logging in the database. <br>

<br>

### HTTPS Server
The bot includes an integrated HTTPS server for Twitch Helix API authentication and forthcoming features. <br>
Set up `server.json` like:
```json
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HOSTNAME",
  "port": 443,
  "host": true,
  "proxy": "YOUR_PROXY",

  "SSL": {
    "fullchain": "/path/to/fullchain.pem",
    "privkey": "/path/to/privkey.pem"
  },

  "JKS": {
    "file": "keystore.jks",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "validity": 365,
    "CN": "Your Name",
    "OU": "Your Organization Unit",
    "O": "Your Organization",
    "L": "Your Location",
    "ST": "Your State",
    "C": "Your Country"
  }
}
```

<br>

### API Keys (optional)
Configure `api.json` for API keys:
```json
{
  "astrology": {
    "clientId": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_ID, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_SECRET, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_SECRET"
  },

  "giphy": "YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY",
  "openWeatherMap": "YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY",
  "riot": "YOUR_RIOT_API_KEY"
