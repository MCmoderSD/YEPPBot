## Description
The YEPPBot is a Twitch-Bot that provides a variety of features to entertain and manage your Twitch channel. <br>

The original idea comes from [FoxxHimself](https://github.com/lennartfu) and was written in Python back in the first half of 2021. <br>
After the original creator stopped working on and maintaining the bot, I took over its maintenance and decided to rewrite it in Java.
The bot has since been fully rewritten in Java 21 using the [Twitch4J](https://twitch4j.github.io/) library. <br>

You can try out the bot on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/YEPPBotV2/chat) to see its features in action. <br>
To use the bot in your own channel, you can add it to your channel using the `!mod join` command. <br>
If you wish to remove the bot from your channel, use the `!mod leave` command in your channel. <br> <br>

For all features to work as intended, you need to authenticate the bot with your Twitch account using the `!mod auth` command in your channel. <br>
While it's recommended to assign the bot a moderator role in your channel to unlock all features, this is not strictly necessary. <br> <br>

If you need help or have any questions, feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://www.mcmodersd.de/dc), [mail](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de) or [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mcmodersd). <br>
I typically respond within 24 hours, often much faster. <br>

If you're interested in collaborating or need a customized version to suit your needs? <br>
Simply email [business@mcmodersd.de](mailto:business@mcmodersd.de). <br> <br>

The bot is currently under active development, and some features may undergo significant changes in the future. <br>
So please note that the setup process for the bot may also change over time. <br>

<hr>

You can use this project as a template to create your own bot or to host your own instance of it. <br>
Setting up the bot is relatively straightforward: you need to create the configuration files and input the required API keys. <br>

However, it is necessary to create a [Twitch application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and provide access to a MySQL database. <br>
For ChatGPT features, as well as certain other features, you need to provide their respective API keys for them to function properly. <br>

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. <br> <br>

## Installation and Setup
For the bot to work, you need to have a few things set up:
- You need to have Java 21 installed on your computer a download link can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
- You need the Twitch account token of the Twitch bot which you can get from [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- And you need to register an application on the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).

Keep in mind that the account token can become invalid after a while and if you change the password of the account. <br>
But remember **DON'T POST** or ever **SHARE** the token anywhere!!! <br> <br>


### 1. Download the bot jar file
You can download the latest version of the bot from the [releases](https://github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot/releases/latest) page. <br>
Create the configuration files yourself, or use the `-generate` argument to create example files. <br>

YAlternatively, you can clone the repository and compile the bot yourself.
To do this, ensure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). <br>

Clone the repository using the following command: <br>
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPBot.git 
``` 
<br>


### 2. Edit the config files
You need to fill in the configuration files with the required information. <br> 
Ignore the names or paths if you use the precompiled JAR file. <br>

You must create two JSON files in the `/src/main/resources/config/` folder. <br>
The first file is `BotConfig.json` and should have the following structure: <br>
```json
{
  "botId": "YOUR_BOT_ID",
  "botName": "YOUR_BOT_NAME, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS, YOUR_BOT_ALIAS",
  "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "prefix": "! ยก",
  "admins": "ADMIN_NAME; OTHER_ADMIN_NAME"
}
```
- **botId**: The ID of the bot account, which you can obtain using this [username to id converter](https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/).
- **botName**: The name of the bot account. You can use multiple names separated by commas so the bot can recognize when it's mentioned.
- **botToken**: The token of the bot account, which you can generate [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The credentials for your Twitch application. 
  - You need to create an application in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). 
  - For testing purposes, use `https://localhost:PORT/callback` as the OAuth Redirect URL. <br> For production, ensure the URL points to your server.
  - Set the application category to **Chatbot** and the Client Type to **Confidential**.
- **prefix**: The character(s) the bot will use to recognize commands.
- **admins**: The users who will have access to admin commands. <br>

The prefix is the character that the bot will use to recognize commands. <br>
The admins are the users that have access to the admin commands. <br>

The second file is optional and is called `Channel.list`. It should have the following structure: <br>
```
CHANNEL_NAME
OTHER_CHANNEL_NAME
``` 
You can add as many channels as you like. 
If no channel list is provided, the bot will default to joining its own channel. <br> <br>


### 3. MySQL Database
To run and use the bot, you need to have your own MySQL database. <br> 
The bot will automatically create the necessary tables and handle the setup, but you must provide a configuration file. <br>

Create a file named `mySQL.json` in the `/src/main/resources/database/`folder. <br> 
The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": "3306",
  "database": "DATABASE_NAME",
  "username": "USER_NAME",
  "password": "USER_PASSWORD"
}
```

- **host**: The hostname or IP address of your MySQL server (e.g., `localhost`). 
- **port**: The port your MySQL server is listening on (default is `3306`).
- **database**: The name of the database the bot will use.
- **username**: The MySQL user with access to the database.
- **password**: The password for the MySQL user.

Ensure that the specified user has full permissions over the entire database. <br>
If you don't want to use the database logging, you can use the `-nolog` argument. <br> <br>


### 4. HTTPS Server
The YEPPBot includes a built-in HTTPS server designed for two key purposes:
1. Handling Helix API authentication.
2. Broadcasting sound via a browser-based interface. (SSL is required for this feature).

#### Configuration
To set up the HTTPS server, create a configuration file named `httpsServer.json` in the `/src/main/resources/config/` directory. <br>
The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HOSTNAME",
  "port": 420,

  "SSL": {
    "fullchain": "/path/to/fullchain.pem",
    "privkey": "/path/to/privkey.pem"
  },

  "JKS": {
    "file": "keystore.jks",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "validity": 365,
    "CN": "Your Name",
    "OU": "Your Organization Unit",
    "O": "Your Organization",
    "L": "Your Location",
    "ST": "Your State",
    "C": "Your Country"
  }
}
```

#### Fields Explained:
- `hostname`: Specify the hostname or IP address the server will bind to (e.g., `localhost` or a public domain). 
- `port`: The port number for the server (default: `420`). 
- `SSL`:
  - `fullchain`: Path to the SSL/TLS certificate chain file (`.pem` format). 
  - `privkey`: Path to the corresponding private key file.
- `JKS` (Java KeyStore): Optional configuration to use a JKS file for SSL instead of `.pem` files. 
  - `file`: Path to the Java KeyStore file. 
  - `password`: Password to access the JKS. 
  - `validity`: Number of days the generated certificate is valid (used when creating a new keystore). 
  - `CN`: Common Name (e.g., your domain name). 
  - `OU`, `O`, `L`, `ST`, `C`: Organizational and geographical details for the certificate.

#### Using a Domain and Valid Certificates:
If you have a domain, you must use a valid certificate. Self-signed certificates are only allowed for `localhost`.
You can obtain a free certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). <br> <br>


### 5. Add API Keys
To configure the bot with API keys, create a file named `apiKeys.json` in the `/src/main/resources/api/` folder. <br> 
The file should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "astrology": {
    "clientId": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_ID, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_ASTROLOGY_CLIENT_SECRET, OPTIONAL_SECOND_CLIENT_SECRET"
  },

  "giphy": "YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY",
  "openWeatherMap": "YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY"
}
```
If you do not wish to use a specific API or do not have the corresponding API key, you can omit that part of the configuration.

#### API Key Sources:
- **Astrology API**: Currently only used for the horoscope feature. Obtain your key from [Prokerala](https://api.prokerala.com/).
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used for the weather command. Obtain your key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- **Giphy API**: Used for GIF integration. Obtain your key from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/). <br> <br>


### 6. Add a ChatGPT API key
You only need to configure this module if you plan to use it. 
For example, if you donโt want to use the image module, you can omit the image part of the configuration. <br>

To set up, create a file named `ChatGPT.json` in the `/src/main/resources/api/` folder. <br> 
The file should have the following structure: <br>
```json
{
  "user": "YOUR_USERNAME",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",

  "chat": {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    "maxConversationCalls": 10,
    "maxTokenSpendingLimit": 8192,
    "temperature": 1,
    "maxOutputTokens": 120,
    "topP": 1,
    "frequencyPenalty": 0,
    "presencePenalty": 0,
    "instruction": "You are the best TwitchBot that ever existed!"
  },

  "image": {
    "model": "dall-e-2",
    "quality": "standard",
    "resolution": "1024x1024",
    "style": "vivid"
  },

  "speech": {
    "model": "tts-1",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "speed": 1,
    "format": "wav"
  }
}
```
Note: <br>
- Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup). <br>
- The `user` field is optional and can be used to identify the user for monitoring purposes. <br>
- Remove any section if you don't intend to use that service.

### 7. Running the bot
After compiling the bot into a `.jar` file, you can run it using the following command:
```bash
java -jar JAR_FILE.jar
```

If you are using the precompiled `.jar` file to generate example configuration files, use:
```bash
java -jar YEPPBot.jar -generate
```

Once you have edited the configuration files and added the necessary API keys, you can start the bot with:
```bash
java -jar YEPPBot.jar -botconfig "/PATH/TO/BotConfig.json" -mysql "/PATH/TO/mySQL.json" -httpsserver "/PATH/TO/httpsserver.json"
```
You can include additional arguments for other configuration files as needed.

#### Custom Commands:
The bot supports creating and managing custom commands with the !CustomCommand command. <br>
Custom commands can include dynamic variables to make them more interactive:
- `%author%`: Replaced with the username of the person executing the command. 
- `%channel%`: Replaced with the name of the channel where the command is executed. 
- `%tagged%`: Replaced with the first word following the command (useful for mentions). 
- `%random%`: Replaced with a random percentage between 0 and 100. <br> <br>


## Docker Setup
Since YEPPBot v1.23.0, you are able to run the bot in a Docker container. <br>
To do this, you need to have Docker installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). <br>

The setup process is similar to the manual setup, but makes managing the bot easier. <br>
You can use the `mcmodersd/yeppbot` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcmodersd/yeppbot). <br>

### 1. Configuration Files
You need to mount a configuration directory to the container. <br>
You have to follow the same steps as the [manual setup](#installation-and-setup) to create the configuration files. <br>

Following files are required:
- The Bot Configuration named `bot.json`.
- The MySQL Configuration named `mysql.json`.
- The HTTPS Server Configuration named `server.json`.

The Channel List, API Keys, and ChatGPT Configuration are optional.
- The Channel List is named `channels.txt`.
- The API Keys are named `api.json`.
- The ChatGPT Configuration is named `openai.json`.

### 2. Running the Docker Container
To run the bot in a Docker container, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --name YEPPBot -p <port>:443 -v /path/to/config:/app/config mcmodersd/yeppbot
```
You need to replace `<port>` with the port you want to use for the HTTPS server. (default 443) <br>
You need to replace `/path/to/config` with the path to the directory containing the configuration files. <br>

If you're using the SSL Certificate instead of the JKS files, you need to mount the directory containing the certificate files. <br>

## YEPPConnect
**YEPPConnect** is a feature that enables your viewers to whitelist their Minecraft usernames directly through the bot.

### Whitelist Commands:
- `!whitelist add McName`: Adds the specified Minecraft username (`McName`) to the whitelist.
- `!whitelist remove McName`: Removes the specified Minecraft username (`McName`) from the whitelist.

### Minecraft Server Setup:
To integrate YEPPConnect with your Minecraft server, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install the [YEPPConnect](https://github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPConnect):
- This plugin connects your Minecraft server to the bot, allowing whitelist management directly from chat.
- It also lets you check the online status of the bot.

#### 2. Compatibility:
- The plugin supports Minecraft version 1.13 and above. 
- Make sure you are using YEPPConnect v1.21.0 or later for full functionality.

#### 3. Documentation:
- Refer to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/MCmoderSD/YEPPConnect?tab=readme-ov-file#commands-and-permissions) for installation instructions, commands, and permissions. <br> <br>
